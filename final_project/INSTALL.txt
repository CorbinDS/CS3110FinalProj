For Windows, you will be using WSL. You need the following libraries:
	Libraries to install:
		- selenium 
		- geckodriver
		- Python3
		- bogue (the installation instructions are specified below.)


Bogue on WSL:
Install https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/
Run XLaunch, choose "One Window" as your display setting.
Make sure the Display Number field has 0 in it. 
Start no client, select the No Access Control checkbox. 
check all 3 boxes in the extra settings window. Press finish, tell windows
firewall to allow access on both network types


Launch Ubuntu
type "export DISPLAY=:0"
type "export LC_ALL=C"
type "export SDL_VIDEO_X11_VISUALID="
(If you want to skip these steps for future Ubuntu launches, 
you can edit bashrc with "nano ~/.bashrc" and add those two commands) 

Important: For Bogue to work, you need SDL 2.0.18. To get this, go to 
https://www.libsdl.org/release/
and download the file named "SDL2-2.0.18.tar.gz". Bring this file into your WSL
and run these commands 
- tar xvzf SDL2-2.0.18.tar.gz
- tar xvjf SDL2-2.0.18.tar.bz2
- cd SDL2-2.0.18
- ./configure
- make
- sudo make install

Now you are free to - opam install bogue

To test Bogue and XMing, type boguex 34. 
When the command first comes in, it should say "INFO: Using SDL 2.0.18"
if not then something went wrong with your installation of SDL, and the example 
will probably crash. If you get any XDG or SDL errors, make sure your XLaunch 
server is running. 

Make sure to have Firefox and Chrome installed. 

For Macs:
	Run the command:
	brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies sdl2

	Then cd into the final project folder called final_project. 
	Once there, run the command: 
	brew install ./sdl2.rb

	Libraries to install: 
		- Homebrew
		- XQuartz
		- XCode 
		- geckodriver (use Homebrew)
		- chromedriver (use Homebrew)
		- Python3
	

Run these commands in (in the listed order) on the terminal (for the other installations necessary for this) for both operating systems:
	Needed in order to scrape information off of the various websites. 
		pip3 install splinter
		pip3 install selenium
		pip3 install pymongo
	
	Needed for to run Python scripts through OCaml: 
		opam install lymp

	Needed for Bogue: 
		opam install graphics
		opam install bogue

	Needed for HTML processing:
		opam install ocurl
		opam install lambdasoup

	Needed in order to convert record types into Json values:
		opam install ppx_yojson_conv
		opam install yojson



Once all these packages are installed, make sure you are in the lowest final_project folder: 
cd final_project
dune build
dune exec bin/main.exe
