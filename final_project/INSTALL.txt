Install OCaml Graphics:	opam install graphics

Bogue on WSL:
Install https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/
Run XLaunch, choose "One Window" as your display setting.
Make sure the Display Number field has 0 in it. 
Start no client, select the No Access Control checkbox. 
check all 3 boxes in the extra settings window. Press finish, tell windows
firewall to allow access on both network types


Launch Ubuntu
type "export DISPLAY=:0"
type "export LC_ALL=C"
type "export SDL_VIDEO_X11_VISUALID="
(If you want to skip these steps for future Ubuntu launches, 
you can edit bashrc with "nano ~/.bashrc" and add those two commands) 

Important: For Bogue to work, you need SDL 2.0.18. To get this, go to 
https://www.libsdl.org/release/
and download the file named "SDL2-2.0.18.tar.gz". Bring this file into your WSL
and run these commands 
- tar xvzf SDL2-2.0.18.tar.gz
- tar xvjf SDL2-2.0.18.tar.bz2
- cd SDL2-2.0.18
- ./configure
- make
- sudo make install

Now you are free to - opam install bogue

To test Bogue and XMing, type boguex 34. 
When the command first comes in, it should say "INFO: Using SDL 2.0.18"
if not then something went wrong with your installation of SDL, and the example 
will probably crash. If you get any XDG or SDL errors, make sure your XLaunch 
server is running. 

Make sure to have Firefox and Chrome installed.
